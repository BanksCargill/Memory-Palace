Project Outline:

The world record for memorization of the digits of the number pi is 100,000 digits. How can such a
feat be accomplished? Thru the memorization technique commonly referred to as Memory
Palaces.

The idea of a memory palace is that you choose a location (the palace) that you are familiar with
and place the numbers that need to be memorized in a predetermined path within that palace.
These “locations” are called loci. The path should be logical, allowing for an ordered traversal, for
example you may choose a path starting from the entrance of your house and repeatedly turning
to your left for the next “location”, like so: location one: entrance, two: living room, three: kitchen
etc. More details about memory palaces can be found here:

Our webapp would create a tool for easily creating, editing and recalling memory palaces specific
to number memorization. We will use a person-action number system to create mnemonics for
every two digit combination from 00 to 99.

To begin using our website, you’ll need to first decide on a set of numbers that you want to
memorize. These could be family members' birth-years or the years that the Star Wars films were
released in order of episode. Next, you’ll create a palace, ideally using a location you are intimately
familiar with to make “walking” through it a simple process. Then you’ll fill the palace with loci.
Each locus can hold between 1 and 4 digits, in 2 digits increments.

Once you have the loci created, it’s time to add your own mnemonics to them. Try to assign
people and actions that are easy for you to encision so that when you use the mnemonic, you can
quickly see the person doing the action. Finally, it’s time to practice. You’ll want to memorize the
mnemonics table so you can quickly recall any of the numbers with person and action. Once
you've done this, walk through your palace, looking at each locus and envisioning the
person/action that will inform you of the number you want to remember.
